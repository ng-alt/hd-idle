Version 1.03
------------

Bugs
- Use %u in dprintf() when reporting number of reads and writes (the
  corresponding variable is an unsigned int).
- Fix example in README where the parameter "-a" was written as "-n".

Version 1.02
------------

Features
- In case the SCSI stop unit command fails with "check condition", print a
  hex dump of the sense buffer to stderr. This is supposed to help
  debugging.

Version 1.01
------------

Features
- The parameter "-a" now also supports symlinks for disk names. Thus, disks
  can be specified using something like /dev/disk/by-uuid/... Use "-d" to
  verify that the resulting disk name is what you want.
  
  Please note that disk names are resolved to device nodes at startup. Also,
  since many entries in /dev/disk/by-xxx are actually partitions, partition
  numbers are automatically removed from the resulting device node.

Bugs
- Not really a bug, but the disk name comparison used strstr which is a bit
  useless because only disks starting with "sd" and a single letter after
  that are currently considered. Replaced the comparison with strcmp()

Version 1.00
------------

Features
- New parameter "-a" to allow selecting idle timeouts for individual disks;
  compatibility to previous releases is maintained by having an implicit
  default which matches all SCSI disks

Bugs
- Changed comparison operator for idle periods from '>' to '>=' to prevent
  adding one polling interval to idle time
- Changed sleep time before calling sync after updating the log file to 1s
  (from 3s) to accumulate fewer dirty blocks before synching. It's still
  a compromize but the log file is for debugging purposes, anyway. A test
  with fsync() was unsuccessful because the next bdflush-initiated sync
  still caused spin-ups.

Version 0.99
------------

Features
- Initial version of hd-idle.
